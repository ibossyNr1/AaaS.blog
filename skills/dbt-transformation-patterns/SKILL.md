# dbt Transformation Patterns

Production-ready patterns for dbt (data build tool) including model organization, testing strategies, documentation, and incremental processing.

## When to Use This Skill

- Building data transformation pipelines with dbt
- Organizing models into staging, intermediate, and marts layers
- Implementing data quality tests
- Creating incremental models for large datasets
- Documenting data models and lineage
- Setting up dbt project structure

## Core Concepts

### 1. Project Structure

Organize dbt projects with clear separation of concerns:

```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
name: my_project
version: '1.0.0'
profile: my_project

model-paths: ["models"]
test-paths: ["tests"]
analysis-paths: ["analyses"]
macro-paths: ["macros"]
seed-paths: ["data"]
docs-paths: ["docs"]
asset-paths: ["assets"]

target-path: "target"  # directory for compiled files
clean-targets:         # directories to be removed by `dbt clean`
  - "target"
  - "dbt_packages"
```

### 2. Model Layers

Follow a layered architecture for maintainability:

1. **Staging models** - Raw data transformations, basic cleaning
2. **Intermediate models** - Business logic, joins, aggregations
3. **Mart models** - Final business-facing tables

### 3. Testing Strategy

Implement comprehensive data quality checks:

```sql
-- models/staging/stg_customers.sql
{{ config(
    materialized='view',
    tags=['staging']
) }}

SELECT
    customer_id,
    customer_name,
    email,
    created_at
FROM {{ source('raw', 'customers') }}

-- Add tests in schema.yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: stg_customers
    description: "Staging model for customer data"
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        description: "Primary key for customers"
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: email
        description: "Customer email address"
        tests:
          - not_null
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['@']  # Basic email validation
```

### 4. Incremental Models

Optimize large datasets with incremental processing:

```sql
-- models/marts/dim_customers.sql
{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    unique_key='customer_id',
    incremental_strategy='merge',
    merge_update_columns=['customer_name', 'email', 'updated_at']
) }}

WITH latest_customers AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        customer_name,
        email,
        created_at,
        updated_at,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY customer_id 
            ORDER BY updated_at DESC
        ) as rn
    FROM {{ ref('stg_customers') }}
    {% if is_incremental() %}
    WHERE updated_at > (SELECT MAX(updated_at) FROM {{ this }})
    {% endif %}
)

SELECT
    customer_id,
    customer_name,
    email,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM latest_customers
WHERE rn = 1
```

### 5. Documentation

Create self-documenting data models:

```yaml
# models/schema.yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: dim_customers
    description: "Dimension table for customer information"
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        description: "Primary key for customers"
      - name: customer_name
        description: "Full name of the customer"
      - name: email
        description: "Customer email address for communication"
      - name: created_at
        description: "Timestamp when the customer was first created"
      - name: updated_at
        description: "Timestamp of the last update to this record"

sources:
  - name: raw
    description: "Raw data from source systems"
    tables:
      - name: customers
        description: "Raw customer data from CRM system"
        columns:
          - name: customer_id
            description: "Customer identifier from source"
          - name: customer_name
            description: "Customer name from source"
```

### 6. Macros for Reusability

Create reusable SQL components:

```sql
-- macros/generate_surrogate_key.sql
{% macro generate_surrogate_key(field_list) -%}
    {{ return(adapter.dispatch('generate_surrogate_key', 'dbt')(field_list)) }}
{%- endmacro %}

{% macro default__generate_surrogate_key(field_list) -%}
    MD5(
        {%- for field in field_list -%}
            {% if not loop.first %} || '|' || {% endif %}
            COALESCE(CAST({{ field }} AS VARCHAR), '')
        {%- endfor -%}
    )
{%- endmacro %}

-- Usage in models
SELECT
    {{ generate_surrogate_key(['customer_id', 'order_date']) }} as order_key,
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    amount
FROM {{ ref('stg_orders') }}
```

## Workflow

1. **Analyze Requirements** - Understand source data and business needs
2. **Design Model Layers** - Plan staging, intermediate, and mart models
3. **Implement Staging Models** - Create initial data transformations
4. **Add Tests** - Implement data quality checks
5. **Build Business Logic** - Create intermediate and mart models
6. **Document** - Add descriptions and lineage
7. **Optimize** - Implement incremental models for large datasets
8. **Deploy** - Set up CI/CD for dbt runs

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control** - Keep all dbt code in Git
2. **Environment Separation** - Use different profiles for dev/staging/prod
3. **CI/CD Integration** - Run tests on every pull request
4. **Monitoring** - Track model run times and test failures
5. **Documentation First** - Write descriptions before implementing models
6. **Incremental Thinking** - Design for scalability from the start

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)

```sql
-- Type 2 SCD implementation
{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    unique_key='customer_scd_key'
) }}

WITH scd_logic AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        customer_name,
        email,
        effective_date,
        COALESCE(
            LEAD(effective_date) OVER (
                PARTITION BY customer_id 
                ORDER BY effective_date
            ) - INTERVAL '1 day',
            '9999-12-31'
        ) as end_date,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY customer_id 
            ORDER BY effective_date DESC
        ) = 1 as is_current
    FROM {{ ref('stg_customer_changes') }}
)

SELECT
    {{ generate_surrogate_key(['customer_id', 'effective_date']) }} as customer_scd_key,
    customer_id,
    customer_name,
    email,
    effective_date,
    end_date,
    is_current
FROM scd_logic
```

### Pattern 2: Data Vault Modeling

```sql
-- Hub table
{{ config(materialized='table') }}

SELECT
    MD5(customer_id) as customer_hkey,
    customer_id,
    LOAD_TIMESTAMP as load_date,
    'CRM' as record_source
FROM {{ source('raw', 'customers') }}

-- Satellite table
{{ config(materialized='table') }}

SELECT
    MD5(customer_id) as customer_hkey,
    customer_name,
    email,
    created_at,
    LOAD_TIMESTAMP as load_date,
    'CRM' as record_source
FROM {{ source('raw', 'customers') }}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Errors** - Check profiles.yml and database permissions
2. **Test Failures** - Review data quality and test logic
3. **Performance Issues** - Optimize with incremental models and indexes
4. **Documentation Gaps** - Ensure all models have descriptions

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Test connection
dbt debug

# Run specific model
dbt run --models stg_customers

# Run tests
dbt test --models stg_customers

# Generate documentation
dbt docs generate

# Serve documentation
dbt docs serve
```
