# Facebook Ads MCP

## 🎯 Triggers
- "Create a Facebook Ads campaign for our new product launch"
- "Generate performance report for our Facebook Ads campaigns"
- "Optimize Facebook Ads bids based on conversion data"
- "Analyze audience demographics for our Facebook Ads"
- "Automate A/B testing for Facebook ad creatives"

## ⚡ Quick Start (Self-Check)
Before running logic, verify readiness:
- [ ] Run `bash ~/.gemini/skills/facebook-ads-mcp/test.sh`.

## 📋 Workflow
1. **Authentication**: Load Facebook Ads API credentials from `.env`
2. **Campaign Management**: Create, update, pause, or delete campaigns

5. **Optimization**: Adjust bids, budgets, and targeting based on performance
