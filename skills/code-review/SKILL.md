# AI-Powered Code Review

## 🎯 Triggers
- "Review this code for security vulnerabilities"
- "Analyze this pull request for code quality issues"
- "Perform comprehensive code review with static analysis"
- "Check this codebase for performance bottlenecks"
- "Assess production readiness of this deployment configuration"
- "Scan for security compliance violations (SOC2, PCI DSS, GDPR)"
- "Evaluate code maintainability and technical debt"

## ⚡ Quick Start (Self-Check)
- [ ] Run `bash ~/.gemini/skills/code-review/test.sh` to verify all analysis tools are available
- [ ] Configure API keys for commercial tools (Snyk, SonarQube, etc.) if needed
- [ ] Set up project-specific analysis rules in `templates/analysis-rules/`

## 📋 Workflow

### 1. **Context Analysis**
- Identify codebase type (web, mobile, backend, infrastructure)
- Determine programming languages and frameworks used
- Review project structure and build configuration
- Identify critical components and security boundaries
- Assess compliance requirements (SOC2, PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)

### 2. **Automated Tool Execution**
- Run language-specific static analysis tools
- Execute security vulnerability scanners
- Perform dependency vulnerability assessment
- Conduct license compliance checking
- Generate code quality metrics and technical debt reports

### 3. **AI-Powered Analysis**
- Integrate with AI review tools (GitHub Copilot, CodeWhisperer, etc.)
- Apply natural language pattern matching for custom rules
- Perform context-aware code smell detection
- Generate intelligent suggestions for improvements
- Create automated pull request comments

### 4. **Manual Expert Review**
- Analyze business logic and architectural decisions
- Review error handling and resilience patterns
- Assess performance implications and scalability
- Evaluate security controls and access management
- Check configuration management and secrets handling

### 5. **Reporting and Recommendations**
- Generate structured feedback by severity and priority
- Provide specific code examples and alternatives
- Create remediation plans with estimated effort
- Document decisions and rationale
- Follow up on implementation progress

## 🤖 System Instructions

### Review Priorities
1. **Security First**: Always prioritize security vulnerabilities over code style issues
2. **Production Impact**: Focus on issues affecting production reliability and performance
3. **Compliance Requirements**: Ensure regulatory and compliance standards are met
4. **Maintainability**: Promote clean code practices and reduce technical debt
5. **Team Standards**: Align with team-specific coding conventions and patterns

### Tool Integration Strategy
- Use open-source tools for initial scanning
- Integrate commercial tools for enterprise-grade analysis
- Combine multiple tools for comprehensive coverage
- Customize rulesets for project-specific requirements
- Automate repetitive analysis tasks

### Response Standards
- **Critical Issues**: Must-fix vulnerabilities with immediate impact
- **High Priority**: Important improvements with significant benefits
- **Medium Priority**: Recommended changes for long-term maintainability
- **Low Priority**: Optional improvements and style suggestions
- **Informational**: Observations without required action
