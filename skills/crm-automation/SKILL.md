## ⚡ Quick Start (Self-Check)
Before running CRM automation:

- Load appropriate API credentials from `.env`
- Test connection to CRM API

### 2. Data Preparation
- Parse input data (CSV, JSON, or manual entry)
- Validate contact/lead information
- Format data according to CRM API requirements

### 3. Operation Execution
- **Contact Sync**: Import/export contacts between systems
- **Lead Creation**: Create new leads with scoring and assignment
- **Pipeline Management**: Update deal stages and values
- **Follow-up Automation**: Schedule and send personalized emails
- **Reporting**: Generate sales metrics and performance analytics

### 4. Verification & Error Handling
- Confirm successful operations
- Log errors and retry failed operations
- Generate summary report

## 📊 Data Models

### Contact Schema:
```json
{
  "email": "required",
  "first_name": "optional",
  "last_name": "optional",
  "company": "optional",
  "phone": "optional",
  "tags": ["lead", "customer", "prospect"],
  "custom_fields": {}
}
```

### Lead Schema:
```json
{
  "source": "website",
  "status": "new",
  "score": 85,
  "owner": "sales_team",
  "expected_value": 5000,
  "timeline": {
    "created": "2025-01-20",
    "next_followup": "2025-01-25"
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Automation Rules

### Lead Scoring Rules:
- +10 points for company email domain
- +20 points for job title containing "director" or "manager"
- +15 points for company size > 100 employees
- +25 points for previous engagement (email opens, website visits)

### Follow-up Triggers:
- New lead created → Send welcome email within 1 hour
- Lead score > 75 → Assign to sales team immediately
- No response in 3 days → Send follow-up email
- Deal stage changed → Notify account manager

3. **Data Validation Errors** - Clean input data before sending
4. **Network Timeouts** - Increase timeout settings

### Recovery Procedures:
