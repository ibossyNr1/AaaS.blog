# Stripe MCP

## 🎯 Triggers
- "Process a payment for a customer"
- "Create a subscription plan"
- "Generate an invoice"
- "Handle Stripe webhook events"
- "Retrieve payment analytics"

## ⚡ Quick Start (Self-Check)
Before running logic, verify readiness:
- [ ] Run `bash ~/.gemini/skills/stripe-mcp/test.sh`.
- [ ] Check `.env` contains required Stripe API keys.
- [ ] Ensure Python and Node.js dependencies are installed.

## 📋 Workflow
1. **Authentication Setup**: Configure Stripe API keys in `.env` file
2. **Payment Processing**: Handle credit card payments, Apple Pay, Google Pay
3. **Subscription Management**: Create and manage recurring billing
4. **Webhook Handling**: Process Stripe events (payment succeeded, failed, etc.)
5. **Reporting**: Generate financial reports and analytics

## 🛠️ Script Reference
- Use `scripts/stripe_payments.py` for payment processing
- Use `scripts/stripe_subscriptions.py` for subscription management
- Use `scripts/stripe_mcp_server.js` for MCP server implementation
- Use `scripts/stripe_webhooks.py` for webhook handling

## 🔐 Security Notes
- Never commit `.env` file with Stripe keys
- Use environment variables in production
- Validate webhook signatures to prevent fraud
